        "\n",
        "This notebook presents an end-to-end workflow for importing, testing, and evaluating two Vision Transformer (ViT) models developed in Keras and PyTorch, respectively.\n",
        "The self-attention mechanism in the ViTs allows these models to learn complex and broad spatial dependencies, providing improved performance on a variety of vision tasks compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. However, the CNNs are adept in learning the local features very well and can be trained using relatively smaller datasets and is generally much more efficient in utilizing the computational resources, as compared to ViTs. A CNN-ViT hybrid architecture gains from both CNN and ViT model strengths, by getting local features extracted using CNNs, while the transformer part of the hybrid architecture can determine the global dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "This lab focuses on model loading, prediction on sample data, and quantitative evaluation of the ViT models created using KEras and PyTorch. You'll explore the details of the framework-specific implementations, test the consistency of results, and gain practical experience comparing deep learning models across different Python ecosystems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon completion, you will have a thorough understanding of loading the CNN-ViT hybrid models testing workflow, key evaluation metrics, and how high-level architectural concepts translate into practical model evaluation using both Keras and PyTorch.\n"
