        "In this notebook, you will learn to build a CNN-Vision Transformer (ViT) hybrid image classification model. You will start by loading an existing CNN that is good at recognizing small patterns in pictures. Then, you'll learn how to improve it with a transformer, which helps the model see and use wider and more complex relationships in an image. The notebook covers important topics like preparing your image data, making your model smarter with both local and global learning, and saving your best results automatically. By the end, you'll understand how CNN-ViT hybrid models work and how to train, evaluate, and visualize them for any image classification task.\n"

        "Congratulations! You've successfully built a CNN-ViT hybrid image classification model.\n",
        "In this lab, you learnt how to combine a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a Vision Transformer (ViT) for advanced image classification tasks. Starting from a pre-trained CNN, you learnt how to extract intermediate features, reshape them as tokens, and provide them with positional embeddings. By stacking transformer encoder blocks on top, the model benefits from both local detail extraction and global context awareness. Throughout the lab, techniques for robust data preparation, efficient training with model checkpoints, and effective visualization of performance were covered. By completing the steps in this notebook, you now have hands-on experience implementing and evaluating a contemporary hybrid vision model using Keras.\n"
